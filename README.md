# About

SimpleConfig is a Class for managing simple configuration files with
python. By simple, it means that they are simple text files, there are
no sections and all options in the configuration files use a strict

```
OPTION=value
```

format, with no spaces between `OPTION`, `=` and `value`.

The same `OPTION` can be used more than once, and you can have multiple
values for each instance. Spaces are allowed in both `OPTION` and
`value` parts.
